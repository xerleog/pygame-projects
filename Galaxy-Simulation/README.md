# Galaxy Simulation

## Description

This project simulates a night-time galaxy view with twinkling stars. The `main.py` script generates stars of varying colors and sizes. The stars will twinkle by continuously adding new stars and changing the radii of existing ones, creating a dynamic and visually engaging effect.

## Features

- **Dynamic Star Generation**: New stars are generated with random colors, positions, and sizes.
- **Twinkling Effect**: A queue is used to cycle stars, replacing the oldest ones while adjusting their sizes for a twinkling effect.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: The galaxy simulates in real-time, showing the continuous appearance and twinkling of stars.

The simulation will start, displaying the galaxy where the stars twinkle in real-time.
